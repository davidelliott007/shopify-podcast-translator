When I make this, I just need to emulater combioned by adding the speaker


export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="Lister-ba5f9edd11af.json"  

There is no 31 in healthish__translations_with_aligned_timing


Ok so what's the order ops now here?

appv3_translate first?

Then text_aligner copy?

Then appTextToSpeech?



I think the fuck up is happening in text-text_aligner
with_aligned



sorted_combined[31].still_to_be_done_element
'Got it. So the most critical part of working with the designer is to spend that upfront work, finding the right designer?\r'

{
  sentence: "Got it. So the most critical part of working with the designer is to spend that upfront work, finding the right designer?\r",
  full_sentences_just_text_filtered_i: 37,
}

"Got it. So when you were putting these mock-ups or prototypes out there to get feedback, how do you ask for it in a way that is going to get you the honest feedback and not just, people being nice?\r"

So wlelement is correct - it has the mockups.

Ok so sorted_combined is the thing that's missing.

Ok so letr's just detect when a UUID changes, and when iut's being changed,

translationTimeCodeUUID

translationPlaying

  let translationPlaying = useSelector(getTranslationPlaying);
  let translationTimeCodeUUID = useSelector(getTranslationTimeCodeAndUUID);


state.translation_playing
MARK_TRANSLATION_AS_PLAYING
MARK_TRANSLATION_AS_DONE_PLAYING? is that what's being 


timecode: state.translation_time_code

markTranslationAsDonePlayingPaused

so eveyrthing happens under announcelisten
translationTimeCodeUUID

getTranslationTimeCodeAndUUID
