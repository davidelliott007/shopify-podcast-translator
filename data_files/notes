When I make this, I just need to emulater combioned by adding the speaker


export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="Lister-ba5f9edd11af.json"  

There is no 31 in healthish__translations_with_aligned_timing


Ok so what's the order ops now here?

appv3_translate first?

Then text_aligner copy?

Then appTextToSpeech?



I think the fuck up is happening in text-text_aligner
with_aligned
