So he encouraged me to start an online business with a physical product and that with Healthish. So I did the starting style course, taught by Gretta van Riel. So she was one of the winners of the Shopify build your business award a few years ago. So she's a really expert in this field.

So one thing that she taught Emily when it comes to finding ideas is, you need to find what Emily said is the golden trifecta, where you need to find a product that's lightweight. So it's easy to ship and the cost of shipping is low. It has high perceived value and it's relatively cost affordable to produce and it's trending. So what Emily did was like, she worked through like at least 20 to 50 ideas and you just got to be just really realistic on if you think that idea can really do well. One thing that I think was really important when choosing the list of ideas for me personally, not only does it have to be easy to ship and lightweight, and it costs affordable  to produce with a high perceived value, but it has to be a trending product because, look, I think, if you want to create a successful physical product business, one thing that's really, really important from my perspective in the business to consumer space is, being able to move the product and sell it online and that's where Instagram comes into play. So it's a very, very visual product. And we had an idea that, a lot of people spend money on things like drink bottles and they're prepared to spend more money than just like... they don't see it as a, I guess you could say everyday product. People are prepared to spend a premium amount, like pay a premium price for a fashionable product or a product that looks great. So that's why I thought that it was a really good product. So I think you need to really focus on, what looks visually good because I think being able to sell on Instagram has been a really big game changer for us as well.
