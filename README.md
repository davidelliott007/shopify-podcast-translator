# How People Talk

# Summary

How People Talk is a learning tool that translates podcasts into the language of your choice; it's designed to help people learn by providing them with their favourite podcasts in a different language!

# How It Works

Based on the podcast transcription, How People Talk translates the transcript into the target language. This translated transcript is then aligned with the original English transcript to provide timestamps. Simultaneously, the translated text is sent to an external API to provide localized sound files.

Once available, the transcripts are then arrayed via React to provide a clickable interface, allowing users to select individual lines in the transcript for instant replay.

# Current Status
